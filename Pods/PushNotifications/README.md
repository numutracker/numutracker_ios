## Building and Running

### Minimum Requirements

- [Swift 4.0+](https://github.com/pusher/push-notifications-swift/commit/d6dfa2186195135d8d7d1e3d3efdd7f8661ea404)
- [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - The easiest way to get Xcode is from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), but you can also download it from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) if you have an AppleID registered with an Apple Developer account.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods version 1.3.1 or newer is recommended to build Pusher Beams.

To integrate Pusher Beams into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

# Replace `<Your Target Name>` with your app's target name.
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'PushNotifications', '~> 1.2.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

> Carthage version 0.26.2 or newer is recommended to build Pusher Beams.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Pusher Beams into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "pusher/push-notifications-swift"
```

Continue following the steps below depending on the platform that you're building the dependency for:

- If you're building for OS X, follow [this](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-os-x) guide.
- If you're building for iOS, tvOS, or watchOS, follow [this](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) guide.

## Running Tests

### Generating Test Coverage Reports

We're using [Slather](https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather) for generating test coverage reports locally and [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) when pull requests are submitted.

### Using Slather

Create a report as static html pages by running:

```bash
slather coverage --html --scheme PushNotifications --workspace PushNotifications.xcworkspace/ PushNotifications/PushNotifications.xcodeproj/
```

Open the html reports:

```bash
open 'html/index.html'
```
