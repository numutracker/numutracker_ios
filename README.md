# Numu Tracker for iOS

Numu Tracker can keep you up to date on music by the artists you love the most. Part to-do list, part reminders and alerts, Numu gives you the tools to ensure you never miss out on new albums.

This app is dependent on the Numu Tracker Backened, [originally built in PHP](https://github.com/amiantos/numutracker_php) but soon to be [rebuilt in Flask](https://github.com/amiantos/numutracker_api).
